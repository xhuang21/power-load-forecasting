# Power Load Forecasting – Final Project Report

## 1. Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Household Power Consumption (2006–2010)
- **Weather Data:** Meteostat (Paris hourly data)
- **Resampling:** All data resampled to hourly frequency
- **Merged Features:** load, temperature, humidity, wind speed, temporal and lag features

## 2. Models
Four forecasting models were implemented:
- SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
- ETS (Exponential Smoothing)
- XGBoost Regressor
- LSTM Neural Network

## 3. Training and Evaluation
| Model | MAE | RMSE |
|--------|-----|------|
| SARIMA | 1.935 | 2.242 |
| ETS | 1.033 | 1.212 |
| XGBoost | 0.944 | 1.088 |
| LSTM | 0.022 | 0.028 |

## 4. Key Findings
- **SARIMA** captures daily seasonality but underperforms due to limited adaptability to nonlinear patterns.
- **ETS** performs better on stable temporal patterns.
- **XGBoost** adapts well to non-seasonal variance.
- **LSTM** achieves the lowest error by learning complex temporal dependencies.

## 5. Visualization
A comparative plot (`comparison_plot.png`) shows the test predictions vs. actual load values for the first 200 hours of 2010.

## 6. Files
- `data/` – raw datasets
- `src/` – all source code (main.py, analyze.py, etc.)
- `results/` – processed features, model results, predictions, plots
- `requirements.txt` – reproducible environment dependencies

## 7. Next Steps
- Add external regressors (temperature forecasts, holidays)
- Try hybrid models (SARIMA+XGBoost)
- Deploy as an API service for real-time forecasting
